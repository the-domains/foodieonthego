title: "This meat-lover's first great-tasting #meatless #vegan #burger at @boonburger #winnipeg . This was a feature of the day, \"Jamaica meCrazy\" with Buddha Patty, curry mayo, bacun, yams, lettuce and tomato. Substituted out the Buddha Patty for grilled boon patty: packed with fresh cremini mushrooms, brown rice, onion, garlic, lemon juice, organic tofu and oats, seasoned with basil, oregano, salt and coarse black pepper. The giraffe is our order animal (they're all different) so they can deliver our order to the table."
