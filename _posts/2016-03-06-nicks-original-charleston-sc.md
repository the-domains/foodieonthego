# Nick's Original, Charleston, SC

Nick's BBQ was fabulous.  You know how you can see a place on the street and something just looks _right _about it?  ![Nick's interior](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/d502b89da9cd1a22655285f8da5b228944c7800d.jpg)

The booths along the wall were filled with diners, in spite of it being between lunch and dinner time.

Check out the brisket, pulled pork, ribs, Mac n Cheese, baked beans and cheese biscuits.

We bought the cheese biscuit mix to bring home.  Would that we could have brought the whole place with us.

Enjoyed in September, 2013
