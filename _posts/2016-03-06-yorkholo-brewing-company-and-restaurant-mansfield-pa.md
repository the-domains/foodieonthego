# Yorkholo Brewing Company, Mansfield, PA

Freshly-made from locally sourced ingredients is what Yorkholo specialize in. These hot-from-the-oven, soft pretzel rolls made with beer and served with homemade honey mustard (or beer cheese) are amazing.

You'll find a lively, casual atmosphere at the Yorkholo brewery restaurant.

We end up sharing a flight of beer to sample all the great varieties in house at Yorkholo.

Like us, you may find that the burger is just the thing to keep those brews company and feed that growling stomach.

While Mansfield may seem off the beaten path, it's got a cute Main Street and Yorkholo makes it even more worthwhile.

Enjoyed in 2012\.
