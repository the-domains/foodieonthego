# Tony Luke's, Philadelphia, PA

Construction workers, city guys and us, waiting for our cheesesteaks at Tony Luke's in South Philly.  ![Order at the window and pick up](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/919ca320ed437d28fcf38f2408977805982f83c9.jpg)

We both ordered the cheesesteak wit (onions). So much better than this picture can possibly show.
