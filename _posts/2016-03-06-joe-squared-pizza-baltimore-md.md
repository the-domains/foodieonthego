# Joe Squared Pizza, Baltimore, MD

We saw Joe Squared on _Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives_, so we had to add it to  our list.  

Joe had a Hawaiian-style pizza and, it being Baltimore, mine was clam, bacon, bocconcini. Oh, yummy!

They use a thin sourdough crust which was music to my mouth.  The coal-fired oven adds bits of char and instead of being flat, the pizza bubbles up in spots to create a light and satisfying bite.

Enjoyed in 2012\.
