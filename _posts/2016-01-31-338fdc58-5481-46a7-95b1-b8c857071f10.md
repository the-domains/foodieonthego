# Musical Pub Crawl, Dublin

We met up with a raucous crowd enjoying some music on the first floor in Oliver St. John Gogarty's pub in the boisterous Temple Bar neighbourhood.  Our group was upstairs, checking in and grabbing a pint as we waited for our evening to  start.

Soon enough, we were hustling our way through the cobbled streets of Temple Bar on a damp evening.

We made our way to the warm and cozy Ha'penny Bridge Inn, where we settled in and our hosts introduced themselves, their musical experience and began to teach us about traditional Irish music and storytelling. I became distracted by the beautiful view out the bar window and was on my 3rd beverage of the night so I'm not sure how much I'd be able to relate on Irish music - but it was fun.

From here we walked over the bridge and through a shopping area to get to Brannigans on the north side.  We were chilled through after our walk and opted for some warm Irish coffees this time.  The best idea ever.
