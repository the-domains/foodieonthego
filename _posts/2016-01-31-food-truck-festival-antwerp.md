# Barrio Cantina Food Truck Festival, Antwerp, Belgium

I consider myself incredibly lucky to get myself to Antwerp in time for the Food Truck Festival - with 6 lines of booths (50+) and free admission. The placement was perfect:  right on the waterfront (Steenplein), next to a looming Steen Castle and across from the Grote Markt. 

There was quite the mix of food vehicles including converted campers and towed trailers,  busily making food. And bikes aplenty, as the bike parking was full - and it was larger than a quarter of the length of the festival.

This bar oasis had its own DJ booth spinning tropical tunes.  The music continued as you walked the festival.  

Mid-way down, another drink booth provided musical accompaniment to the imbibers on picnic benches lining the water's side.  There was even a DJ and laser light show in the hallway of the building with the public restrooms (although I'm not sure it was connected to the festival).

The variety of food on offer ranged from Belgian frites to Mexican soft corn tacos to Indian tandoori chicken and naan to Vietnamese spring rolls.  I was in foodie heaven.  A fresh coconut drink was all the rage, with a long line-up waiting for the team to hack each coconut open.

All in all, people were in a happy, celebratory mood which made it that much more fun.
