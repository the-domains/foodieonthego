# The Willow Tea Rooms, Glasgow, Scotland

As we purchased tickets to tour the architecture of Charles Rennie Mackintosh at the Glasgow School of Art, our host suggested we spend our waiting time at the Willow Tea Room on Buchanan Street, nearby. Mackintosh had designed these rooms and their furniture. It was a brilliant and most appreciated suggestion, as this 2nd floor accessible aerie was open, bright, warm and inviting.

We shared a cream tea service, with a strained hot tea and scones with cream and jam.
