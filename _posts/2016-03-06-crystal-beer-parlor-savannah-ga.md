# Crystal Beer Parlor, Savannah, GA

Crab Stew with a sidecar of sherry. So good I forgot the sherry! Chunks of crab meat throughout in a chowder-ish sauce, but more buttery. Served with Lance Saltine crackers.

My first-ever Fried Green Tomatoes! These were breaded with panko and served with a horseradish cream sauce. Non-traditional, maybe, but good.

Warm peach cobbler, heavy on the peach and light on the cobbler, as I like it. With vanilla ice cream, all melty on top.
