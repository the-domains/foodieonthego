![My first-ever Fried Green Tomatoes! These were breaded with panko and served with a horseradish cream sauce. Non-traditional, maybe, but good.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/813eba72366e4fe266f0bc2f274e5a16eaebaad5.jpg)
![Warm peach cobbler, heavy on the peach and light on the cobbler, as I like it. With vanilla ice cream, all melty on top.](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/624e27e334e076cb3763a765373db3ffe03aaeee.jpg)
