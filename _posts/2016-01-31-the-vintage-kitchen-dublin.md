# The Vintage Kitchen, Dublin

Lucky me, I hear about this great little restaurant, run by a chef, which serves up Irish fare and plays vinyl while they're doing it.  We, of course, have to go.  After a number of back-and-forth emails and texts (because every time we proposed was closed or booked) we have a reservation!  This is not the place to just drop in.

The Vintage Kitchen is located on a side street, and looks like a little shop from the outside.  The front has a few tables, with a handful more running along the left wall.  They run 2 seatings a night, typically.  We were able to squeeze in early so we'd be able to make a 7pm appointment, following.  The waiter was charming, funny, and, since they remembered it was our anniversary, surprised us with 2 glasses of champagne before we even had water. ![Vintage Kitchen table with champagne](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/afde4896-77fd-4d67-a2b0-fb9dab03a9a2.jpg)

The rustic bread plate and spread kept us occupied while we weighed our choices on the menu.  Somehow, we manage to order, although it was a tough decision.

Joe's first course was a red pepper and pancetta risotto, while I followed the recommendation of other reviewers and the waiter and chose the Donegal smoked haddock chowder with chorizo and wild samphire.  I won this round hands down, as I could not imagine anything more delicious, from the light broth which was mid-creamy and deep with flavour to the samphire, with texture like mini asparagus, which were a surprise and delight .

For something to follow, Joe ordered their special that night, which was a lovely glazed pork belly and roasted vegetables.  I confess that I have a weakness for lamb, and will almost invariably order it if I find it on a menu, so mine was the Slaney River slow-roasted lamb shank, fricassee of squash and roasted sweet potato, twice-cooked parsnip and treacle gravy.  Joe loved the pork belly but admitted that the lamb shank was a star.

Sadly, we had to exit quickly to make our next evening appointment, but the friendly staff convinced us they'd let us back in if we came in later that night for dessert.  The half-baked chocolate cake was calling to me...
