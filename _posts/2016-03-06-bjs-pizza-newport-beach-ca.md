# BJ's Pizza, Newport Beach, CA

BJ's is something of an institution in the Newport/Balboa area, having opened in the late 1970's.

At BJ's there are other things on the menu, but to me, this is the place to get really good deep dish pizza, loaded up with toppings.  You'll also find good beer here.
