Shops and restaurants spill onto the street to sell their wares.

The Indian food is fresh and delicious, and it's a great place to sample new things.

Some smart retailers have even created photo opportunities for you and your kids (or dogs!).

It's lots of fun to explore Gerrard Street on its own, or to come out for the Festival and browse through and stumble on the new and different.
