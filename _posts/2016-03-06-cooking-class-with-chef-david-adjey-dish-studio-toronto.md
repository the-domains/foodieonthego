# Cooking Class with Chef David Adjey, Dish Cooking Studio, Toronto

Every once in awhile, you stumble on a special experience and your friend jumps into it with you. This was one of those occasions.

Dish Studio was well-stocked with kitchen implements and the sous chefs had already prepared the ingredients for us when we arrived.

We were given the opportunity to get hands-on and prepare 3 different meals.  Chef Adjey made his way around to provide instruction and tips.

As everything comes together, you order your wine and sit down for mini-meal after mini-meal.  It's all so good.

Rib Steak with sweet potato, Swiss chard vegetable mix, succotash. I've never even liked succotash before.  This was delicious.
